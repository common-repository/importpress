- Import images from Google Drive or your computer and resize or crop them to fit
- Use links to anchor to different sections of your content or link to other pages on your site

Choose what you would like to import from Google Drive into WordPress. (Pro-tip: You can import multiple documents at 
a time, including those authored by you, your team, or anyone else who has shared access to them.) Change the title, 
status, post type, category, and authors as needed before importing.
